Activity 3:  
SQL databases are based on a relational model with data stored in various tables and the data can be linked via relations. It allows for efficient storage, avoids duplication, and updating data values is quite simple. However, it requires joining of various tables to extract particular information. NoSQL databases do not have a relational model, and oftentimes just use collections. It has fast query times, but has duplication, no join operation, and updating some data fields may be expensive as each document may require an update. For smaller datasets however, both types perform fairly evenly performance-wise.
